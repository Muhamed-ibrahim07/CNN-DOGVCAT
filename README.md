🐶🐱 Dog vs Cat Classifier using CNN & TensorFlow
This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that distinguishes between dogs and cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on a dataset of labeled dog and cat images to achieve high accuracy in classification.

🚀 Features
Implemented CNN architecture for image classification.
Used TensorFlow and Keras for model development.
Data preprocessing including image augmentation and normalization.
Utilized multiple models and fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between dogs and cats.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow & Keras
OpenCV & NumPy for image processing
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images of dogs and cats. The images are preprocessed, resized, and augmented to enhance generalization.

🔥 How It Works
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Train the CNN model with different architectures.
Evaluate the model on test data.
Predict whether an input image is a dog or a cat.
📌 Future Enhancements
Implement Transfer Learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet.
Improve accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.
Deploy as a web app using Flask or FastAPI.
